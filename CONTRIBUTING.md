# How to contribute

Anyone is free to contribute with code, source code needs that. As in any project, there are few guidelines that we need 
contributors to follow, heading to a better way to change things and keep all running.

# Commits

Commits messages are essentials when tring to fix bugs. Once you can filter the content each commit should apply, you can find code
changes faster. We follow the [karma-commit-msgs](http://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) to create commits.

Example for a commit message:
```
feat(cpu) - Add CPU arch filter scheduler support

In a mixed environment ofâ€¦
```

## A good commit message should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will: ```<your commit subject here>```

### Rules for a great git commit message style:
  
  * Separate subject from body with a blank line.
  
  * Do not end the subject line with a period.
  
  * Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph.
  
  * Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
  
  * Wrap lines at 72 characters.
  
  * Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has 
  been made.
  
  # Code Guide Line
  
  We follow the [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md)
